- dsa_perf_micros uses the x86_energy_perf_policy and cpupower applications to tune CPU power management for performance, these applications can be built/installed from the kernel source tree or installed using the OS package management utilities. If these applications are missing, dsa_perf_micros will print corresponding error messages but continue to work.
