Intel(R) Memory Latency Checker (for Internal Use Only) - v3.9a-RC2-internal
Command line parameters: --loaded_latency -R -t60 -d0 -k1-29 

Using buffer size of 100.000MiB/thread for reads and an additional 100.000MiB/thread for writes
*** Unable to modify prefetchers (try executing 'modprobe msr')
*** So, enabling random access for latency measurements

Measuring Loaded Latencies for the system
Using all the threads from each core if Hyper-threading is enabled
Using Read-only traffic type
Inject	Latency	Bandwidth
Delay	(ns)	MB/sec
